# Robotic-simulation-2025

Lists dependencies (e.g., pip packages, Python version).
Explains how to reproduce the main experiment or
result.

Path-Planning on the ESP32 (up to 4 points)
You get points for implementing one of the options:
3.0: Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented and running on the
ESP32 to compute the shortest path between the current robot
position and a pre-defined goal node.
4.0: A* or D* Lite algorithm is implemented and running on the
ESP32 to compute the shortest path between the current robot
position and a pre-defined goal node using valid heuristics.
GradeRobotics
Evidence: The simulated robot on Webots consistently follows
the shortest path from its position to any pre-fedined goal node
while controlled by the code running on the ESP32.
