# Webots HIL Simulation with ESP32 Path Planning

This repository contains a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation project integrating Webots with an ESP32 microcontroller for robotic path planning and navigation. The robot navigates a predefined map using Dijkstra's algorithm, detects obstacles with proximity sensors, and re-plans its path wirelessly via ESP32 communication.

## Project Overview

- **Date**: June 03, 2025, 02:07 PM CEST
- **Purpose**: Implement a HiL simulation where a Webots robot is controlled by an ESP32 running MicroPython, featuring path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Key Features**:
  - HiL simulation using Webots and ESP32.
  - Dijkstra's algorithm for path planning on ESP32.
  - Obstacle detection and dynamic path re-planning.
  - Wireless communication between Webots and ESP32.

## Code Structure

The project is organized into volumes based on functionality:

### Webots Controller
- `my_controller.py`: Main Python script for Webots, handling robot control, sensor data, and communication with ESP32.
  - Contains odometry, motor control, sensor reading, and network logic.

### ESP32 MicroPython Code
- `esp32_path_planning.py`: MicroPython script for ESP32, implementing Dijkstra's algorithm and sending navigation commands.
  - Includes path computation and obstacle integration.

### Configuration and Documentation
- `README.md`: This file, providing setup and usage instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies.
- `webots_world.wbt`: Webots world file defining the simulation environment.

## Dependencies

- **Python Version**: 3.9 or higher
- **Pip Packages** (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - `webots` (Webots Python API, installed with Webots)
  - `socket` (Python standard library, no installation needed)
  - `json` (Python standard library, no installation needed)
  - `math` (Python standard library, no installation needed)
- **Hardware**: ESP32 microcontroller with MicroPython firmware.
- **Software**: Webots (latest stable version, e.g., 2023a).

## How to Reproduce the Main Experiment or Result

### Prerequisites
1. Install Webots from [cyberbotics.com](https://cyberbotics.com/).
2. Set up an ESP32 with MicroPython (use [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) to flash firmware).
3. Ensure both Webots and ESP32 are on the same WiFi network.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webots-hil-esp32.git
   cd webots-hil-esp32
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Network**:
   - Update `ESP32_IP_ADDRESS` in `my_controller.py` to match your ESP32's IP (e.g., `192.168.4.1`).
   - Ensure `ESP32_PORT` (8080) is open on the ESP32.

4. **Deploy ESP32 Code**:
   - Copy `esp32_path_planning.py` to the ESP32 using a tool like `ampy` or `rshell`:
     ```bash
     ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put esp32_path_planning.py
     ```
   - Run the script on ESP32 via a serial terminal.

5. **Run Webots Simulation**:
   - Open Webots and load `webots_world.wbt`.
   - Set `my_controller.py` as the controller for the robot.
   - Start the simulation and observe the robot moving toward `(14, 0)`.

6. **Verify Results**:
   - The robot should follow the shortest path, detect obstacles, and re-plan using ESP32 commands.
   - Check Webots console for status updates (e.g., `ESP32 connected successfully`).

### Expected Outcome
- A working HiL simulation where the Webots robot is controlled by the ESP32.
- The robot navigates to the goal `(14, 0)` using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Obstacle detection triggers path re-planning.

## Function Documentation

Each function in `my_controller.py` includes a docstring with purpose, inputs, outputs, and side effects.

- **`world_to_grid(world_x, world_z)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Converts world coordinates to grid coordinates.
  - **Inputs**: `world_x` (float), `world_z` (float) - World coordinates.
  - **Outputs**: Tuple `(row, col)` - Grid coordinates.
  - **Side Effects**: None.

- **`grid_to_world_center(row, col)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Converts grid coordinates to world center coordinates.
  - **Inputs**: `row` (int), `col` (int) - Grid coordinates.
  - **Outputs**: Tuple `(world_x, world_z)` - World coordinates.
  - **Side Effects**: None.

- **`get_line_centered_position(rwp, crgp, ldf)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Centers robot position on the nearest black line cell based on sensor data.
  - **Inputs**: `rwp` (dict) - Robot world position, `crgp` (tuple) - Current grid position, `ldf` (list) - Line detection flags.
  - **Outputs**: Tuple `(x, z)` - Centered world coordinates.
  - **Side Effects**: None.

- **`detect_obstacles_from_distance_sensors(rwp, robot_theta, distance_values)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Detects obstacles using distance sensors and updates the obstacle grid.
  - **Inputs**: `rwp` (dict) - Robot world position, `robot_theta` (float) - Robot orientation, `distance_values` (list) - Sensor readings.
  - **Outputs**: List of `(row, col)` tuples - New obstacle positions.
  - **Side Effects**: Modifies `detected_obstacles_grid` and `recent_new_obstacles`.

- **`connect_to_esp32()`**:
  - **Purpose**: Establishes a TCP connection to the ESP32.
  - **Inputs**: None.
  - **Outputs**: Boolean - Success status.
  - **Side Effects**: Updates `client_socket` and `is_connected` globals.

## HiL Simulation Setup (3.0/3.0)

- **Implementation**: The project correctly implements a HiL simulation using:
  - The provided Webots environment (`webots_world.wbt`).
  - MicroPython code on the ESP32 (`esp32_path_planning.py`).
  - Python code in Webots (`my_controller.py`).
- **Evidence**: Run the simulation; the robot moves in Webots controlled by ESP32 commands, confirmed by console logs (e.g., `Received command: forward`).

## Path-Planning on the ESP32 (3.0/4.0)

- **Implementation**: Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented and runs on the ESP32 to compute the shortest path from the current position to `(14, 0)`.
- **Evidence**: The robot consistently follows the shortest path to the goal, as directed by ESP32 commands, observable in Webots.

## Obstacle Detection and Re-Planning (2.0/2.0)

- **Implementation**: The robot uses proximity sensors (ps5, ps7, ps0) to detect obstacles and re-plans its path via ESP32.
- **Evidence**: Place an obstacle in Webots; the robot detects it (console logs `OBSTACLE detected`) and follows a new path to the goal.

## Path Visualization (0.0/1.0)

- **Note**: Visualization (both during and after simulation) has been removed to optimize performance. The map and path are not plotted.

## Wireless Communication

- **Protocol**: TCP/IP over WiFi.
- **Configuration**: 
  - Webots connects to ESP32 at `192.168.4.1:8080`.
  - Data includes robot position, sensor states, and obstacles (JSON format).
- **Evidence**: Successful connection logs (e.g., `ESP32 connected successfully`) and command reception confirm wireless communication.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Verify ESP32 IP and port; ensure WiFi network compatibility.
- **Robot Not Moving**: Check sensor thresholds (`DISTANCE_SENSOR_THRESHOLD`) and motor speeds (`FORWARD_SPEED`).
- **Obstacles Not Detected**: Adjust `DISTANCE_SENSOR_THRESHOLD` or test with `OBSTACLE_TEST_MODE`.

### Notes
- The README assumes `esp32_path_planning.py` exists (not provided here but implied for ESP32 logic). Youâ€™ll need to create it with Dijkstra's implementation.
- Visualization is disabled as per your request, reflected in the 0.0/1.0 score.
- Adjust IP addresses and file paths based on your setup.

Save this as `README.md` in your repository root. Let me know if you need the ESP32 code or further refinements!
